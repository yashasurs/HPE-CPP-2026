## Common Errors

Amazon EC2 Instance Connect API Reference
Common Parameters
The following list contains the parameters that all actions use for signing Signature Version 4 
requests with a query string. Any action-speciﬁc parameters are listed in the topic for that action. 
For more information about Signature Version 4, see Signing AWS API requests in the IAM User 
Guide.
Action
The action to be performed.
Type: string
Required: Yes
Version
The API version that the request is written for, expressed in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
Type: string
Required: Yes
X-Amz-Algorithm
The hash algorithm that you used to create the request signature.
Condition: Specify this parameter when you include authentication information in a query 
string instead of in the HTTP authorization header.
Type: string
Valid Values: AWS4-HMAC-SHA256
Required: Conditional
X-Amz-Credential
The credential scope value, which is a string that includes your access key, the date, the region 
you are targeting, the service you are requesting, and a termination string ("aws4_request"). 
The value is expressed in the following format: access_key/YYYYMMDD/region/service/
aws4_request.
API Version 2018-04-02 14
Amazon EC2 Instance Connect API Reference
For more information, see Create a signed AWS API request in the IAM User Guide.
Condition: Specify this parameter when you include authentication information in a query 
string instead of in the HTTP authorization header.
Type: string
Required: Conditional
X-Amz-Date
The date that is used to create the signature. The format must be ISO 8601 basic format

signing requests. If the Date header is speciﬁed in the ISO 8601 basic format, X-Amz-Date is not 
required. When X-Amz-Date is used, it always overrides the value of the Date header. For more 
information, see Elements of an AWS API request signature in the IAM User Guide.
Type: string
Required: Conditional
X-Amz-Security-Token
The temporary security token that was obtained through a call to AWS Security Token Service

security token.
Type: string
Required: Conditional
X-Amz-Signature
Speciﬁes the hex-encoded signature that was calculated from the string to sign and the derived
